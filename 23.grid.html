          Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November
          1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of
          the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an
          occasional medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal
          Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli
          is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.[3] He
          holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks
          third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international
          cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in
          ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international
          centuries scored. Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the
          2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India
          to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and
          2019.[5] In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for
          ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.[6] In
          2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian
          cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the
          game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In
          2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer
          of the decade.[7] He has received many accolades for his performances
          in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in
          2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers
          Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in
          2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win
          both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year.
          Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three
          consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was
          honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and
          India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna award, in 2018. In
          2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most
          influential people in the world. Kohli has been deemed one of the most
          commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of ₹634 crore
          (US$79 million) in the year 2022. Early life Virat Kohli was born on 5
          November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem
          Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli,
          served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older
          sister, Bhawna.[8] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar.
          He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[9]
          According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket
          as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display
          natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[10] In 1998, the
          West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year,
          Prem Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket,
          assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to
          meet Rajkumar Sharma.[11] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours,
          Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket
          academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more
          than just playing in gully cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he
          faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14
          Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli
          reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs,
          which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals.
          Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[13] He
          received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in
          matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[14]
          In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to
          Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[12] On 18
          December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a
          cerebral attack.[12][15] During his childhood, his father played a
          crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited
          his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has
          expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at
          times.[9][16] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted
          noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound
          seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to
          the sport.[12] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar
          until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[17] Career
          Main article: Career of Virat Kohli Player profile Comparisons to
          Sachin Tendulkar Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have
          frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he
          regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed
          as Tendulkar's "successor",[18][19] he is widely considered to have
          the potential to surpass his records in the future.[20][21] His
          reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his
          formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has
          stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating
          his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[22] Kohli's
          aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing
          greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's
          similarities to his own playing style.[23] He has been lauded as the
          "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian
          cricketer.[24] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that
          Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[25] Kohli's skills with
          the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian
          Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside
          Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[26] In a discourse with the
          prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli
          possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international
          centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and
          the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[27] In 2013,
          Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an
          era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the
          team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had
          been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned
          the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his
          possession.[28] Playing style Kohli is considered as an enterprising
          batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing
          demeanour.[29][30] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is
          at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[31] and a
          resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for
          his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for
          adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure
          situations.[32][33] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour
          playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is
          appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent
          prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[34][35] Kohli playing his
          famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Kohli has often
          expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be
          his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick
          shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[10]
          Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique
          is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield
          runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[36] Kohli is
          known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play.
          He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while
          also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His
          combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to
          craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field
          positioning.[37] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for
          his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[38] However, Kohli has a known
          vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[39]
          Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such
          deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[40] This vulnerability
          has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[41][42]
          Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay
          Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[43][44] and former New
          Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is
          particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[45] Kohli has
          garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent
          limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados
          alike.[46][3] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting
          second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[47] He has amassed 27 of his
          50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,[48] and holds the record for the most
          hundreds scored when batting second.[49] In reference to his success
          while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge
          of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate
          his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary
          hits.[50] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication,
          concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his
          success.[51][52] Aggression Kohli's playing style is widely regarded
          as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He
          is well known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field
          situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[53][54] His
          captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and
          leading the team by example.[55] Kohli has been the subject of much
          media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career.
